# Segment Demo

## Getting Started

This project requires Node.js to be installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Another option is to use a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Node.js. If you have Homebrew installed, you can run the following command:

```sh
$ brew install node
```

For this project, we will be using the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package to serve the files locally. You can install it globally by running the following command:

```sh 
$ npm i
```

Then you can start the server by running the following command:

```sh
$ http-server
```

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080. These files will now be served over HTTP, which will bypass the CORS restrictions.
